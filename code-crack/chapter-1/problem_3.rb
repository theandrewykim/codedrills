# Design an algorithm and write the code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without uisng any additional buffer. NOTE: one or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.
# FOLLOW UP
# Write the test cases for this method


# Would write a similar algorithim to problem 1.
